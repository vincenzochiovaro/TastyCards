Tasty Cards

# Work In Progress . . .

Tasty Cards is a TypeScript React project that seamlessly connects to my backend API, allowing users to explore a catalog of recipes and generate random ones. With its user-friendly interface built on Bootstrap, users can interact with the app by leaving likes and comments on their favourite recipes.
